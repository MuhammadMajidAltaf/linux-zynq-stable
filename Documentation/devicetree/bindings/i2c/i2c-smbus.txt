* i2c-smbus extensions

Required Properties:
  - compatible: Must contain "smbus_alert"
  - interrupts: The irq line for smbus ALERT signal
  - reg: I2C slave address. Set to 0x0C (alert response address).

Note: The i2c-smbus module registers itself as a slave I2C device. Whenever
a smbus controller directly support smbus extensions (and its driver supports
this), there is no need to add anything special to the DT. Otherwise, for using
i2c-smbus with any smbus-extensions-unaware I2C controllers, you need to
route the smbus ALARM signal to an extra IRQ line, thus you need to describe
this in the DT.

Example:
	alert@0x0C {
		reg = <0x0C>;
		compatible = "smbus_alert";
		interrupts = <0 36 IRQ_TYPE_LEVEL_LOW>;
	};
