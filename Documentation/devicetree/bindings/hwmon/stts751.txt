* STTS751 thermometer.

Required node properties:
- compatible: "st,stts751"
- reg: I2C bus address of the device

Optional properties:
- has-therm: specifies that the "therm" pin is wired
- has-event: specifies that the "event" pin is wired
- therm-hyst: default hyisteresys in milliCelsius for therm
- therm-val: default threshold in milliCelsius for therm
- event-max: default max threshold in milliCelsius for event
- event-min: default min threshold in milliCelsius for event

Example stts751 node:

temp-sensor {
	compatible = "st,stts751";
	reg = <0x48>;
	has-therm;
	has-event;
	therm-hyst = <5000>;
	therm-val = <650000>;
	event-max = <900000>;
	event-min = <-10000>;
}
